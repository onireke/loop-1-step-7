      <p class="respect">
        <strong>T</strong>he desire to be respected by someone of opposite sex is something that runs deep within everyone, even though most people don't take the time to find someone whon truly respect them. It seems like people are just looking for someone to show them the slightest amount of attention, settling for something much less than respect. I am convinced one of the best ways to help any relationshi grow is by showing respect.

      <p class="respect">
        I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected. What is respect? Respect is showing someone extra special attention, or high regard, based on a desire to show them how highly they are valued.
